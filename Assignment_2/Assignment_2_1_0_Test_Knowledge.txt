1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
String:
Use String when you have a small number of concatenation operations or when the immutability of the string is important.
String is immutable, meaning any modification creates a new string object. This can be inefficient for frequent modifications.

StringBuilder:
Use StringBuilder when you need to perform numerous string manipulations, such as concatenations, appends, or inserts, which would be inefficient with String.
StringBuilder is mutable, meaning it can be modified without creating new objects, which improves performance for frequent modifications.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
The base class for all arrays in C# is System.Array.

3. How do you sort an array in C#?
sort an array in C# using the Array.Sort() method
----
int[] numbers = { 7, 3, 6, 2, 1 };
Array.Sort(numbers);
----

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
The Length property of an array object is used to get the total number of elements in an array.
---
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 };
int totalElements = numbers.Length;
---

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
No, System.Array is designed to store elements of a single data type. 
To store multiple data types, you can use collections like ArrayList or List<object>, 
though this is generally not recommended due to type safety and performance considerations.

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?

System.Array.CopyTo():

Copies the elements of the array to another existing array starting at a specified index.
It requires you to provide the target array where elements will be copied.

System.Array.Clone():

Creates a shallow copy of the array and returns a new array object.
It returns a new array with the same elements as the original array.
